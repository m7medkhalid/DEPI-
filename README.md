📄 Project Description:
This project involves designing and implementing a secure network infrastructure for a small business with 30 employees. The network supports employee workstations, shared printers, a local server, and guest WiFi while ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive business data. The project is structured across four weeks and aligns with CCNA-level skills and best practices.

🛠️ Key Deliverables & Technologies:
🔹 Week 1 – Network Design:

Developed a comprehensive network topology including routers, switches, access points, and a firewall.

Created a subnetted IP addressing scheme to separate employee, server, and guest zones.

Defined network security policies including firewall rules, IPS, and a secure VPN plan for remote access.

🔹 Week 2 – Configuration & Implementation:

Configured routers, switches, and wireless access points.

Implemented VLANs for network segmentation and routing protocols for internal communication.

Deployed firewall ACLs and IDPS to protect against cyber threats.

Established a secure VPN for remote user access with encryption and access controls.

🔹 Week 3 – Security Implementation & Testing:

Applied hardening measures like disabling unused services and securing management interfaces.

Conducted vulnerability assessments and addressed identified issues.

Enabled logging and monitoring systems to detect suspicious network activity.

🔹 Week 4 – Documentation & Final Presentation:

Produced complete network documentation: topology diagrams, addressing plan, firewall policies, and security protocols.

Outlined incident response procedures and ongoing monitoring strategies.

Presented the project findings, demonstrating a secure, functional, and scalable network.

🎯 Outcome:
The final network solution ensures reliable connectivity, secure data access, proper segmentation, and defense-in-depth strategies suitable for small business operations. This hands-on implementation showcases practical CCNA skills in real-world scenarios, focusing on both functionality and cybersecurity.
